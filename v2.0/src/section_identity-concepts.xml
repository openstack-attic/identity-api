    <para>To use OpenStack Identity, you must be familiar with these
        key concepts:</para>

            <term><emphasis role="bold">User</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A digital representation of a person, system, or
                    service that uses OpenStack cloud services.
                    OpenStack Identity authentication services
                    validate that an incoming request is being made by
                    the user who claims to be making the call.</para>
                <para>Users have a login and may be assigned tokens to
                    access resources. Users may be directly assigned
                    to a particular tenant and behave as if they are
                    contained in that tenant.</para>

                >Authentication</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>In the context OpenStack Identity, the act of
                    confirming the identity of a user or the truth of
                    a claim. OpenStack Identity confirms that an
                    incoming request is being made by the user who
                    claims to be making the call by validating a set
                    of claims that the user is making.</para>
                <para>These claims are initially in the form of a set
                    of credentials (username &amp; password, or
                    username and API key). After initial confirmation,
                    OpenStack Identity issues the user a token, which
                    the user can then provide to demonstrate that
                    their identity has been authenticated when making
                    subsequent requests.</para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term><emphasis role="bold">Token</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An arbitrary bit of text that is used to access
                    resources. Each token has a scope that describes
                    which resources are accessible with it. A token
                    may be revoked at anytime and is valid for a
                    finite duration.</para>
                <para>While OpenStack Identity supports token-based
                    authentication in this release, the intention is
                    for it to support additional protocols in the
                    future. The intent is for it to be an integration
                    service foremost, and not aspire to be a
                    full-fledged identity store and management
                    solution.</para>

            <term><emphasis role="bold">Tenant</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A container used to group or isolate resources
                    and/or identity objects. Depending on the service
                    operator, a tenant can map to a customer, account,
                    organization, or project.</para>

            <term><emphasis role="bold">Service</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An OpenStack service, such as Compute (Nova),
                    Object Storage (Swift), or Image Service (Glance).
                    A service provides one or more endpoints through
                    which users can access resources and perform
                    operations.</para>

            <term><emphasis role="bold">Endpoint</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A network-accessible address, usually described
                    by a URL, where a service may be accessed. If
                    using an extension for templates, you can create
                    an endpoint template, which represents the
                    templates of all the consumable services that are
                    available across the regions.</para>

        <varlistentry>
            <term><emphasis role="bold">Role</emphasis></term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A personality that a user assumes when
                    performing a specific set of operations. A role
                    includes a set of rights and privileges. A user
                    assuming that role inherits those rights and
                    privileges.</para>
                <para>In OpenStack Identity, a token that is issued to
                    a user includes the list of roles that user can
                    assume. Services that are being called by that
                    user determine how they interpret the set of roles
                    a user has and to which operations or resources
                    each role grants access.</para>
                <para>It is up to individual services such as the
                    Compute service and Image service to assign
                    meaning to these roles. As far as the Identity
                    service is concerned, a role is an arbitrary name
                    assigned by the user.</para>
