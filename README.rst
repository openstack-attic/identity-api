This repository contains the RESTful API information for the OpenStack Identity Service, also known as the Keystone project. The Keystone project provides authentication for OpenStack services, with plans to also provide authorization.

In short, to build v3 docs with Maven 3::

    cd openstack-identity-api/v3
    mvn clean generate-sources

To build v2.0 docs with Maven 3::

    cd openstack-identity-api/v2.0
    mvn clean generate-sources
