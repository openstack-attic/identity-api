OpenStack Identity API v3 OS-SHARED-SECRET-AUTHENTICATION Extension
===================================================================

Provide the ability for identity users to request a token using a shared
secret authentication method. This extension requires v3.0+ of the Identity API.
The user provides an identification method using a `credential_id` and the
corresponding shared secret information as a `secret`.

`Shared-secret` is facilitated by the `credentials` resource in Identity API v3.

Definitions
-----------

- *User:* An Identity API service user and the entity that authorizes the
  creation of an Access Token.
- *Access Token:* A token used to request new Identity API tokens
  tokens on behalf of the authorizing User, instead of using the Userâ€™s
  credentials.
- *Credential_id:* An id used by the User to identify the corresponding
  credentials.
- *Shared-Secret:* A shared secret used by the User to establish ownership of
  the Request.

Authentication Flow
-------------------

Authentication via Shared Secret is done in two steps:

1. A `credentials` resource is created in Identity API v3 with `type` equal to
   `shared-secret`, where the `blob` is an ASCII string.
2. An Identity API service User requests an Identity API token passing
   `credential_id` and `secret` as part of the `shared-secret` method.

API Resources
-------------

### Credential APIs

This specification establishes a new credential type `shared-secret`, which will
be used by the `shared-secret` authentication method. The `blob` field shell
contains an ASCII string.

Example:

{
    "credential": {
        "blob": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
        "id": "3512532",
        "links": {
            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/credentials/3512532"
        },
        "project_id": "263fd9",
        "type": "shared-secret",
        "user_id": "0ca8f6"
    }
}

### Request an Identity API Token: `POST /auth/tokens`

To perform `shared-secret` authentication, `credential_id` and `secret` must be
specified in the authentication payload. `credential_id` and `secret` must match
`id` and `blob` of an existing credential of type `shared-secret`.

Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "shared-secret"
                ],
                "shared-secret": {
                    "credential_id":"3512532",
                    "secret":"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
                }
            }
        }
    }

The returned token for the above request is unscoped.

However, this identity method can be used in conjunction with the scope
attribute using the syntax described in the Identity API.
