OpenStack Identity API v3 OS-SHARED-SECRET Extension
====================================================

Provide the ability for identity users to request a token using an shared
secret authorization method. This extension requires v3.0+ of the Identity API.
The user provides an identification method using an `id` and the
corresponding shared secret information as a `shared-secret`.

Definitions
-----------

- *User:* An Identity API service user and the entity that authorizes the
  creation of an Access Tokens.
- *Access Token:* A token used to request new Identity API tokens
  tokens on behalf of the authorizing User, instead of using the Userâ€™s
  credentials.
- *Id:* An id used by the User to identify the corresponding credentials.
- *Shared-Secret:* A shared secret used by the User to establish ownership of
  the Request.

Authentication Flow
-------------------

Authentication via Shared Secret is done in two steps:

1. In the Credential API a shared-secret type is defined. This type defines
   the blob as a shared-secred composed by a string having at least 64 and no
   more than 512 characters.
2. An Identity API service User requests an Identity API token passing `id` and
   `secret` as part of the `shared-secret` method.

API Resources
-------------

### Request an Identity API Token: `POST /auth/tokens`

The User can identify the credentials to use by providing a unique id, `id`,
and a shared secret with the service, `shared-secret`. The secret and access id
management is provided by the Credential API service as illustrated in the
example below:

{
    "credential": {
        "blob": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
        "id": "3512532",
        "links": {
            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/credentials/80239a"
        },
        "project_id": "263fd9",
        "type": "shared-secret",
        "user_id": "0ca8f6"
    }
}

Request Parameters:

To authenticate with the OS-SHARED-SECRET extension, `access-id` must be
specified as an authentication method.
Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "shared-secret"
                ],
                "shared-secret": {
                    "id":"3512532",
                    "secret":"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
                }
            }
        }
    }

The returned token for the above request is unscoped.

However, this identity method can be used in conjunctio with the scope attribute
using the syntax described in the Identity API.
