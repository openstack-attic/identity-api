OpenStack Identity API v3 OS-OAUTH10A Extension
===============================================

Provide the ability for users to delegate roles to third party consumers. This
extension requires v3.0+ of the Identity API. An OAuth-derived token will
provide a means of acting on behalf of the authorizing user.

Definitions
-----------------

- *User:* An Identity API service user, the entity whose role(s) will be
  delegated, and the entity that authorizes Request Tokens.
- *Request Token:* A token used by the Consumer to obtain authorization from
  the User, and exchanged with an OAuth Verifier for an Access Token.
- *Access Token:* A token used by the Consumer to request new Identity API
  tokens on behalf of the authorizing User, instead of using the Userâ€™s
  credentials.
- *Token Key:* A key used by the token to identify itself. Both Request Tokens
  and Access Tokens have Token Keys.
- *Token Secret:* A secret used by the Consumer to establish ownership of a
  given Token. Both Request Tokens and Access Tokens have Token Secrets.
- *OAuth Verifier:* A string that must be provided with the corresponding
  Request Token in exchange for an Access Token.

Delegated Authentication Flow
-----------------------------

Delegated Authentication via OAuth is done in four steps:

1. An Identity API service User [creates a Consumer](#Create Consumer).
2. The Consumer [obtains an unauthorized Request Token](#Create Request Token).
3. The User [authorizes the Request Token](#Authorize Request Token).
4. The Consumer [exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token](#Create
   Access Token).
5. The Consumer [uses the Access Token to request a Identity API service
   Token](#Request an Identity API Token).

API Resources
-------------

### Consumers: `/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers`

A Consumer is an application that uses OAuth to access a protected resource.

Optional attributes:

- `description` (string)

Immutable attributes provided by the Identity service:

- `consumer_key` (string)

  A value used by the Consumer to identify itself.

- `consumer_secret` (string)

  A secret used by the Consumer to establish ownership of the `consumer_key`.
  A consumer's secret is only returned once, during consumer creation.

The Consumer is given it's key and secret, out-of-band.

Consumers API
-------------

### Create Consumer: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/consumers`

Request:

    {
        "consumer": {
            "description": "My consumer"
        }
    }

Response:

The `consumer_secret` is only returned once, during consumer creation.

    Status: 201 Created

    {
        "consumer": {
            "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
            "consumer_secret": "4c7832",

            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/7fea2d"
            }
        }
    }

### List Consumers: `GET /OS-OAUTH10A/consumers`

Response:

    Status: 200 OK

    {
        "consumers": [

                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/0c2a74"
                }
            },
            {
                "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
                "description": "My consumer",

            "previous": null,
            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers"
        }
    }

### Get Consumer: `GET /OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/{consumer_id}`

Response:

    Status: 200 OK

    {
        "consumer": {
            "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
            "id": "7fea2d",
            "description": "My consumer",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/7fea2d"
            },
            "name": "consumer_name"
        }
    }

### Delete Consumer: `DELETE /OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/{consumer_id}`

When a Consumer is deleted, any Request Tokens, Access Tokens, or Identity API
Tokens will also be deleted.

Response:

    Status: 204 No Content

### Update Consumer: `PATCH /OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/{consumer_id}`

Only a Consumer's `description` is mutable. Attempting to PATCH an immutable
attribute should result in a HTTP 400 Bad Request.

Request:

    {
        "consumer": {
            "description": "My new consumer"
        }
    }

Response:

    Status: 200 OK

    {
        "consumer": {
            "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
            "description": "My new consumer",
            "id": "7fea2d",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/7fea2d"
            }
        }
    }

Delegated Auth APIs
-------------------

### Create Request Token: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/request_token`

A Consumer uses the Consumer Key and Secret to obtain a Request Token. The
Request Token is used to initiate User authorization. The Request Token, once
authorized, can be exchanged along with the OAuth Verifier for an Access
Token. Note that there are two extra parameters, `requested_role_ids` and
`requested_project_id`. `requested_role_ids` contains the IDs of the roles the
Consumer would like delegated. `requested_project_id` contains the ID of the
project upon which the requested roles must be assigned. The Identity service
may include an `oauth_expires_at` attribute in the response. If no such
attribute is included, or is null, then the token may last indefinitely.

The authorizing User receives the Request Token Key and requested roles from
the Consumer out-of-band.

#### Supported signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`

Request Parameters:

- All required OAuth parameters must be provided.

  See: [http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step1](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step1)

Additional Request Parameters:

- `requested_role_ids`: IDs of requested roles, comma separated

  - Example: `requested_role_ids=a3b29b,49993e`

- `requested_project_id`: IDs of requested project

  - Example: `requested_project_id=b9fca3`

Response:

  `oauth_token=29971f&oauth_token_secret=238eb8&oauth_expires_at=2013-09-11T06:07:51.501805Z`

Response Parameters:

  - `oauth_token`: The Request Token that the Identity Service returns.
  - `oauth_token_secret`: The secret associated with the Request Token.
  - `oauth_expires_at`: The date and time when a Request Token will expire.

### Authorize Request Token: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/authorize/{request_key}`

FIXME(dolph): what's a request key? an `oauth_token` value?

To authorize the Request Token, the authorizing user must have the requested
role assignments on the requested project. Upon successful authorization, an
OAuth Verifier code is returned. The Consumer receives the OAuth Verifier from
the User out-of-band.

Request:

    {
        "roles": [
            {
                "id": "xyz789"
            }
        ]
    }

Response:

    {
        "token": {
            "oauth_verifier": "8171"
        }
    }

### Create Access Token: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/access_token`

After the User authorizes the Request Token, the Consumer exchanges the
authorized Request Token and OAuth Verifier for an Access Token. The Identity
service may include an `oauth_expires_at` parameter in the response. If no such
parameter is included, then the token lasts indefinitely.

#### Supported signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`

Request Parameters:

- All required OAuth parameters must be provided.

  See: [http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step3](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step3)

Response:

    oauth_token=aj9CovPUo44isTgs9F&oauth_token_secret=tCoZQiHWPMe8HMv5LFYPZvsMp3tkG5u_QM&oauth_expires_at=2013-09-11T06:07:51.501805Z

Response Parameters:

- `oauth_token`: The Request Token that the Identity Service returns.
- `oauth_token_secret`: The secret associated with the Request Token.
- `oauth_expires_at` (optional): The ISO 8601 datetime at which an Access Token will expire.

### Request an Identity API Token: `POST /auth/tokens`

The Consumer can now request valid Identity API service tokens representing the
authorizing User's delegated authorization and identity (impersonation).
The generated token's roles and scope will match that which the Consumer
initially requested.

#### Supported signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`

Request Parameters:

- All required OAuth parameters must be provided.

  See: [http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor12](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor12)

The returned token is scoped to the requested project and with the requested
roles. In addition to the standard token response, as seen in the link below,
the token has an OAuth-specific object.

Example OpenStack token response: [Various Openstack token responses](https://github.com/openstack/identity-api/blob/master/openstack-identity-api/v3/src/markdown/identity-api-v3.md#authentication-responses)

Example OAuth-specific object in a token:

    "OS-OAUTH10A": {
        "access_key": "cce0b8be7",
        "consumer": {
            "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
            "description": "My new consumer",
            "id": "7fea2d",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/consumers/7fea2d"
            }
        },
        "roles": [
            {
                "id": "f381f0f600e",
                "name": "admin"
                "links": {
                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/roles/f381f0f600e"
                }
            }
        ]
    }

User Access Token APIs
----------------------

A User can list Access Tokens that have been authorized.

### List user authorizations: `GET /OS-OAUTH10A/users/{user_id}/authorizations`

Response:

    {
        "authorizations": [
            {
                "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
                "id": "6be26a",
                "expires_at": "2013-09-11T06:07:51.501805Z",
                "access_key": "6be26a",
                "links": {
                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/authorizations/6be26a"
                },
                "requested_role_ids": [
                    {
                        "id": "76e72a",
                        "name": "admin",
                        "links": {
                            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/roles/76e72a"
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "requested_project_id": "b9fca3",
                "authorizing_user_id": "ce9e07"
            }
        ],
        "links": {
            "next": null,
            "previous": null,
            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/users/ce9e07/authorizations"
        }
    }

A User can revoke an Access Token, preventing the Consumer from requesting new
Identity API service tokens. This also revokes any Identity API tokens issued
to the Consumer using that Access Token.

### Delete user authorization: `DELETE /OS-OAUTH10A/users/{user_id}/authorizations/{access_key}`

Response:

    Status: 204 No Content
