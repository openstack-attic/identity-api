OpenStack Identity API v3 OS-OAUTH10A Extension
===============================================

Provide the ability for users to delegate roles to third party consumers. This
extension requires v3.0+ of the Identity API. An OAuth-derived token will
provide a means of acting on behalf of the authorizing user.

Definitions
-----------------

- *User:* An Identity API service user, the entity whose role(s) will be
  delegated, and the entity that authorizes Request Tokens.
- *Request Token:* A token used by the Consumer to obtain authorization from
  the User, and exchanged with an OAuth Verifier for an Access Token. Short
  lived token - defaults to expire in 8 hours.
- *Access Token:* A token used by the Consumer to request new Identity API
  Service Tokens on behalf of the authorizing User, instead of using the Userâ€™s
  credentials. Long lived token - defaults to expire in 20 days.
- *Token Key:* A key used by the token to identify itself. Both Request and
  Access Tokens have Keys.
- *Token Secret:* A secret used by the Consumer to establish ownership of a
  given Token. Both Request and Access Tokens have Secrets.
- *OAuth Verifier:* A four digit numeric string tied to the Request Token. The
  OAuth Verifier and Request Token both must be provided to exchange for an
  Access Token.

Delegated Authentication Flow
-----------------------------

Delegated Authentication via OAuth is done in four steps:

1. An Identity API service User [creates a Consumer](#Create Consumer).
2. The Consumer [obtains an unauthorized Request Token](#Create Request Token).
3. The User [authorizes the Request Token](#Authorize Request Token).
4. The Consumer [exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token](#Create
   Access Token).
5. The Consumer [uses the Access Token to request a Identity API service
   Token](#Request a Identity API Token).

Consumer APIs
-------------

A Consumer is an application that uses OAuth to access a protected resource.
The Consumer is identified by a `name` and `id`. A Consumer also has both a
`consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`.

- `consumer_key`: A value used by the Consumer to identify itself.
- `consumer_secret`: A secret used by the Consumer to establish ownership of
  the `consumer_key`.

The Consumer is given it's key and secret, out-of-band.

            },
            "name": "new_consumer_name"
        }
    }

Delegated Auth APIs
-------------------

### Create Request Token: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/request_token`

A Consumer uses the Consumer Key and Secret to obtain a Request Token. The
Request Token is used to initiate User authorization. The Request Token, once
authorized, can can be exchanged, along with the OAuth Verifier for an Access
Token. By default, a Request Token will expire in 8 hours, however this can be
changed in keystone.conf with the tag `request_token_expiry` under the `oauth`
header. Note that the Request Token begins to expire once it is created. Note
that the extra parameter `requested_roles` containing the names of the roles
the Consumer would like to access, must be supplied.

The authorizing User receives the Request Token Key and requested roles from
the Consumer out-of-band.

#### Supported signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`

Request Parameters:

- All usual OAuth parameters must be provided.
    See: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step1

Additional Request Parameters:

- requested_roles: name of requested roles, comma separated
    Example: requested_roles="nova_launcher,service"

Response:

    {
        "token": {
            "request_token_key": "bf6903c804b5441da754d220add679ec",
            "request_token_secret": "9908bec765ae47b4b47a685c9401c9ec"
        }
    }

### Authorize Request Token: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/authorize/{request_id}/{requested_roles}`

To authorize the Request Token, the authorizing User must be assigned the
roles that are being requested.
Upon successful authorization a four digit OAuth Verifier code is returned.

The Consumer receives the OAuth Verifier from the User out-of-band.

Response:

    {
        "token": {
            "oauth_verifier": "8171"
        }
    }

### Create Access Token: `POST /OS-OAUTH10A/access_token`

After the User authorizes the Request Token, the Consumer exchanges the
authorized Request Token and OAuth Verifier for an Access Token.
By default, an Access Token will expire in 20 days, however this can
be changed in keystone.conf with the tag `access_token_expiry` under
the `oauth` header.

#### Supported signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`

Request Parameters:

- All usual oauth parameters must be provided.
    See: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#auth_step3

Response:

    {
        "token": {
            "access_token_key": "6be26a",
            "access_token_secret": "05f12466ea9c4120a1378310e7fc96a3"
        }
    }

### Request a Identity API Token: `GET /OS-OAUTH10A/authenticate`

The Consumer can now request valid Identity API service tokens which would have
the User's delegated authorization. An OAuth-derived token provides a means to
impersonate the authorizing user. The generated token's roles will match the
requested roles that the Consumer initially requested.

#### Supported signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`

Request Parameters:

- All usual oauth parameters must be provided.
    See: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor12

The returned token is scoped to the authorizing user's project and with the
requested roles. In addition to the usual token response, as seen in the link
below, the token has an OAuth section.

Example OpenStack token response:

https://github.com/openstack/identity-api/blob/master/openstack-identity-api/v3/src/markdown/identity-api-v3.md#authentication-responses

Example OAuth section of a token:

    OS-OAUTH10A:oauth: {
        "access_token_key": "cce0b8be7",
        "consumer_id": "181f67c7",
        "consumer_name": "stevemar2",
        "roles": [
            {
                "id": "f381f0f600e"
                "name": "admin"
            }
        ]
    }

User Access Token APIs
----------------------

A User can list Access Tokens that have been authorized.

### List user authorizations: `GET /OS-OAUTH10A/users/{user_id}/authorizations`

Response:

    {
        "authorizations": [
            {
                "consumer_key": "7fea2d",
                "id": "6be26a",
                "issued_at": "2013-07-11T06:07:51.501805Z",
                "expires_at": "2013-09-11T06:07:51.501805Z",
                "access_key": "6be26a",
                "links": {
                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/authorizations/6be26a"
                },
                "requested_roles": [
                    {
                        "id": "76e72a",
                        "name": "admin",
                        "links": {
                            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/roles/76e72a"
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "project_id": "bff721",
                "user_id": "ce9e07"
            }
        ],
        "links": {
            "next": null,
            "previous": null,
            "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/OS-OAUTH10A/users/ce9e07/authorizations"
        }
    }

A User can remove authorization of an Access Token, preventing the Consumer
from requesting new Identity API service tokens. This also deletes any Identity
API service tokens issued to the Consumer.

### Delete user authorizations: `DELETE /OS-OAUTH10A/users/{user_id}/authorization/{authorization_id}`

Response:

    Status: 204 No Content
