OpenStack Identity API v3
=========================

The Identity API primarily fulfills authentication and authorization needs
within OpenStack, and is intended to provide a programmatic facade in front of
existing authentication and authorization system(s).

The Identity API also provides endpoint discovery through a service catalog,
identity management, project management, and a centralized repository for
policy engine rule sets.

What's New in Version 3.1
-------------------------

- Nothing, yet.

What's New in Version 3.0
-------------------------

- Former "Service" and "Admin" APIs (including CRUD operations previously
  defined in the v2 OS-KSADM extension) are consolidated into a single core API
- "Tenants" are now known as "projects"
- "Groups": a container representing a collection of users
- "Domains": a high-level container for projects, users and groups
- "Policies": a centralized repository for policy engine rule sets
- "Credentials": generic credential storage per user (e.g. EC2, PKI, SSH, etc.)
- Roles can be granted at either the domain or project level
- User, group and project names only have to be unique within their owning
  domain
- Retrieving your list of projects (previously `GET /tenants`) is now
  explicitly based on your user ID: `GET /users/{user_id}/projects`
- Tokens explicitly represent user+project or user+domain pairs
- Partial updates are performed using the HTTP `PATCH` method
- Token ID values no longer appear in URLs

API Conventions
---------------

The Identity API provides a RESTful JSON interface.

Each REST resource contains a canonically unique identifier (ID) defined by the
Identity service implementation and is provided as the `id` attribute; Resource
ID's are strings of non-zero length.

The resource paths of all collections are plural and are represented at the
root of the API (e.g. `/v3/policies`).

TCP port 35357 is designated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
("IANA") for use by OpenStack Identity services. Example API requests &
responses in this document therefore assume that the Identity service
implementation is deployed at the root of `http://identity:35357/`.

### Required Attributes

Headers:

 - `X-Auth-Token`

   This header is used to convey the authentication token when accessing
   Identity APIs.

 - `X-Subject-Token`

   This header is used to convey the subject of the request for token-related
   operations.

For collections:

- `links` (object)

  Specifies a list of relational links to the collection.

  - `self` (url)

    A self-relational link provided as an absolute URL. This attribute is
    provided by the identity service implementation.

  - `previous` (url)

    A relational link to the previous page of the list, provided as an absolute
    URL. This attribute is provided by the identity service implementation. May
    be null.

  - `next` (url)

    A relational to the next page of the list, provided as an absolute URL.
    This attribute is provided by the identity service implementation. May be
    null.

For members:

- `id` (string)

  Globally unique resource identifier. This attribute is provided by the
  identity service implementation.

- `links` (object)

  Specifies a set of relational links relative to the collection member.

  - `self` (url)

    A self-relational link provided as an absolute URL. This attribute is
    provided by the identity service implementation.

### CRUD Operations

Unless otherwise documented (tokens being the notable exception), all resources
provided by the Identity API support basic CRUD operations (create, read,
update, delete).

The examples in this section utilize a resource collection of Entities on
`/v3/entities` which is not actually a part of the Identity API, and is used
for illustrative purposes only.

#### Create an Entity

When creating an entity, you must provide all required attributes (except those
provided by the Identity service implementation, such as the resource ID):

Request:

    POST /entities

    {
        "entity": {
            "name": string,
            "description": string,
            "enabled": boolean
        }
    }

The full entity is returned in a successful response (including the new
resource's ID and a self-relational link), keyed by the singular form of the
resource name:

    201 Created

    {
        "entity": {
            "id": string,
            "name": string,
            "description": string,
            "enabled": boolean,
            "links": {
                "self": url
            }
        }
    }

#### List Entities

Request the entire collection of entities:

    GET /entities

A successful response includes a list of anonymous dictionaries, keyed by the
plural form of the resource name (identical to that found in the resource URL):

    200 OK

    {
        "entities": [
            {
                "id": string,
                "name": string,
                "description": string,
                "enabled": boolean,
                "links": {
                    "self": url
                }
            },
            {
                "id": string,
                "name": string,
                "description": string,
                "enabled": boolean,
                "links": {
                    "self": url
                }
            }
        ],
        "links": {
            "self": url,
            "next": url,
            "previous": url
        }
    }

##### List Entities filtered by attribute

Beyond each resource's canonically unique identifier (the `id` attribute), not
all attributes are guaranteed unique on their own. To list resources which match
a specified attribute value, we can perform a filter query using a query string
with one or more attribute/value pairs:

    GET /entities?name={entity_name}&enabled={entity_enabled}

The response is a subset of the full collection:

    200 OK

    {
        "entities": [
            {
                "id": string,
                "name": string,
                "description": string,
                "enabled": boolean,
                "links": {
                    "self": url
                }
            }
        ],
        "links": {
            "self": url,
            "next": url,
            "previous": url
        }
    }

#### Get an Entity

Request a specific entity by ID:

    GET /entities/{entity_id}

The full resource is returned in response:

    200 OK

    {
        "entity": {
            "id": string,
            "name": string,
            "description": string,
            "enabled": boolean,
            "links": {
                "self": url
            }
        }
    }

##### Nested collections

An entity may contain nested collections, in which case the required attributes
for collections still apply; however, to avoid conflicts with other required
attributes, the required attributes of the collection are prefixed with the
name of the collection. For example, if an `entity` contains a nested
collection of `objects`, the `links` for the collection of `objects` is called
`objects_links`:

    {
        "entity": {
            "id": string,
            "name": string,
            "description": string,
            "enabled": boolean,
            "links": {
                "self": url
            },
            "objects": [
                {
                    "id": string,
                    "name": string,
                    "description": string,
                    "enabled": boolean,
                    "links": {
                        "self": url
                    }
                }
            ],
            "objects_links": {
                "self": url,
                "next": url,
                "previous": url
            }
        }
    }

#### Update an Entity

Partially update an entity (unlike a standard `PUT` operation, only the
specified attributes are replaced):

    PATCH /entities/{entity_id}

    {
        "entity": {
            "description": string
        }
    }

The full entity is returned in response:

    200 OK

    {
        "entity": {
            "id": string,
            "name": string,
            "description": string,
            "enabled": boolean,
            "links": {
                "self": url
            }
        }
    }

#### Delete an Entity

Delete a specific entity by ID:

    DELETE /entities/{entity_id}

A successful response does not include a body:

    204 No Content

### HTTP Status Codes

The Identity API uses a subset of the available HTTP status codes to
communicate specific success and failure conditions to the client.

#### 200 OK

This status code is returned in response to successful `GET` and `PATCH`
operations.

#### 201 Created

This status code is returned in response to successful `POST` operations.

#### 204 No Content

This status code is returned in response to successful `HEAD`, `PUT` and
`DELETE` operations.

#### 300 Multiple Choices

This status code is returned by the root identity endpoint, with references to
one or more Identity API versions (such as ``/v3/``).

#### 400 Bad Request

This status code is returned when the Identity service fails to parse the
request as expected. This is most frequently returned when a required attribute
is missing, a disallowed attribute is specified (such as an `id` on `POST` in a
basic CRUD operation), or an attribute is provided of an unexpected data type.

The client is assumed to be in error.

#### 401 Unauthorized

This status code is returned when either authentication has not been performed,
the provided X-Auth-Token is invalid or authentication credentials are invalid
(including the user, project or domain having been disabled).

#### 403 Forbidden

This status code is returned when the request is successfully authenticated but
not authorized to perform the requested action.

#### 404 Not Found

This status code is returned in response to failed `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`,
`PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` operations when a referenced entity cannot be found
by ID. In the case of a `POST` request, the referenced entity may be in the
request body as opposed to the resource path.

#### 409 Conflict

This status code is returned in response to failed `POST` and `PATCH`
operations. For example, when a client attempts to update an entity's unique
attribute which conflicts with that of another entity in the same collection.

Alternatively, a client should expect this status code when attempting to
perform the same create operation twice in a row on a collection with a
user-defined and unique attribute. For example, a User's `name` attribute is
defined to be unique and user-defined, so making the same ``POST /users``
request twice in a row will result in this status code.

The client is assumed to be in error.

#### 500 Internal Server Error

This status code is returned when an unexpected error has occurred in the
Identity service implementation.

#### 501 Not Implemented

This status code is returned when the Identity service implementation is unable
to fulfill the request because it is incapable of implementing the entire API
as specified.

For example, an Identity service may be incapable of returning an exhaustive
collection of Projects with any reasonable expectation of performance, or lack
the necessary permission to create or modify the collection of users (which may
be managed by a remote system); the implementation may therefore choose to
return this status code to communicate this condition to the client.

#### 503 Service Unavailable

This status code is returned when the Identity service is unable to communicate
with a backend service, or by a proxy in front of the Identity service unable
to communicate with the Identity service itself.

API Resources
-------------

### Users: `/v3/users`

User entities represent individual API consumers and are owned by a specific
domain.

Role grants explicitly associate users with projects or domains. Each
user-project or user-domain pair can have a unique set of roles granted on them.

A user without any role grants is effectively useless from the perspective of
an OpenStack service and should never have access to any resources. It is
allowed, however, as a means of acquiring or loading users from external
sources prior to mapping them to projects.

Additional required attributes:

- `name` (string)

  Either globally or domain unique username, depending on owning domain.

Optional attributes:

- `domain_id` (string)

  References the domain which owns the user; if a domain is not specified by
  the client, the Identity service implementation will default it to the domain
  to which the client's token is scoped.

- `default_project_id` (string)

  References the user's default project against which to authorize, if the API
  user does not explicitly specify one when creating a token. Setting this
  attribute does not grant any actual authorization on the project, and is
  merely provided for the user's convenience. Therefore, the referenced
  project does not need to exist within the user's domain.

- `description` (string)

- `enabled` (boolean)

  Setting this value to `false` prevents the user from authenticating or
  receiving authorization. Additionally, all pre-existing tokens held by the
  user are immediately invalidated. Re-enabling a user does not re-enable
  pre-existing tokens.

- `password` (string)

  The default form of credential used during authentication.

- `expiry_time` (datetime)

  The time this user entry becomes invalid. Omitting this value will create
  a permanent entry. Token's issued to a user with an expiry_time cannot be
  valid for longer than the lifetime of the user.

- `id` (string)

  The ID this user should have, if omitted uuid will be generated internally.

Example entity:

    {
        "user": {
            "default_project_id": "263fd9",
            "domain_id": "1789d1",
            "email": "joe@example.com",
            "enabled": true,
            "id": "0ca8f6",
            "expiry_time": "2013-05-16T13:22:21.99999Z", 
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/users/0ca8f6"
            },
            "name": "Joe"
        }
    }

### Groups: `/v3/groups`

Group entities represent a collection of Users and are owned by a specific
domain. As with individual users, role grants explicitly associate groups with
projects or domains. A group role grant onto a project/domain is the equivalent
of granting each individual member of the group the role on that
project/domain. Once a group role grant has been made, the addition or removal
of a user to such a group will result in the automatic granting/revoking of
that role to the user, which will also cause any token containing that user and
project/domain to be revoked.

As with users, a group entity without any role grants is effectively useless
from the perspective an OpenStack service and should never have access to any
resources. It is allowed, however, as a means of acquiring or loading
users/groups from external sources prior to mapping them to projects/domains.

Additional required attributes:

- `name` (string)

  Unique group name, within the owning domain.

Optional attributes:

- `domain_id` (string)

  References the domain which owns the group; if a domain is not specified by
  the client, the Identity service implementation will default it to the domain
  to which the client's token is scoped.

- `description` (string)

Example entity:

    {
        "group": {
            "description": "Developers cleared for work on all general projects"
            "domain_id": "1789d1",
            "id": "70febc",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/groups/70febc"
            },
            "name": "Developers"
        }
    }

### Credentials: `/v3/credentials`

Credentials represent arbitrary authentication credentials associated with a
user. A user may have zero or more credentials, each optionally scoped to a
specific project.

Additional required attributes:

- `user_id` (string)

  References the user which owns the credential.

- `type` (string)

  Representing the credential type, such as `ec2` or `cert`. A specific
  implementation may determine the list of supported types.

- `blob` (blob)

  Arbitrary blob of the credential data, to be parsed according to the `type`.

Optional attributes:

- `project_id` (string)

  References a project which limits the scope the credential applies to.

Example entity:

    {
        "credential": {
            "blob": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
            "id": "80239a",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/credentials/80239a"
            },
            "project_id": "263fd9",
            "type": "ec2",
            "user_id": "0ca8f6"
        }
    }

### Projects: `/v3/projects`

Projects represent the base unit of "ownership" in OpenStack, in that all
resources in OpenStack should be owned by a specific project ("projects" were
also formerly known as "tenants"). A project itself must be owned by a specific
domain.

Required attributes:

- `name` (string)

  Either globally or domain unique project name, depending on owning domain.

Optional attributes:

- `domain_id` (string)

  References the domain which owns the project; if a domain is not specified by
  the client, the Identity service implementation will default it to the domain
  to which the client's token is scoped.

- `description` (string)

- `enabled` (boolean)

  Setting this attribute to `false` prevents users from authorizing against
  this project. Additionally, all pre-existing tokens authorized for the
  project are immediately invalidated. Re-enabling a project does not re-enable
  pre-existing tokens.

Example entity:

    {
        "project": {
            "domain_id": "1789d1",
            "enabled": true,
            "id": "263fd9",
            "name": "project-x",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/projects/263fd9"
            }
        }
    }

### Domains: `/v3/domains`

Domains represent collections of users, groups and projects. Each is owned
by exactly one domain. Users, however, can be associated with multiple
projects by granting roles to the user on a project (including projects owned
by other domains).

Each domain defines a namespace in which certain API-visible name attributes
exist, which affects whether those names need to be globally unique or simply
unique within that domain. Within the Identity API, there are five such name
attributes, whose uniqueness are affected by the domain:

- *Domain Name*: This is always globally unique across all domains.

- *Role Name*: This is always globally unique across all domains.

- *User Name*: This is only unique within the owning domain.

- *Project Name*: This is only unique within the owning domain.

- *Group Name*: This is only unique within the owning domain.

Additional required attributes:

- `name` (string)

  Globally unique name.

Optional attributes:

- `description` (string)

- `enabled` (boolean)

  Setting this attribute to `false` prevents users from authorizing against
  this domain or any projects owned by this domain, and prevents users owned by
  this domain from authenticating or receiving any other authorization.
  Additionally, all pre-existing tokens applicable to the above entities are
  immediately invalidated. Re-enabling a domain does not re-enable
  pre-existing tokens.

Example entity:

    {
        "domain": {
            "enabled": true,
            "id": "1789d1",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/domains/1789d1"
            },
            "name": "example.com"
        }
    }

### Roles: `/v3/roles/`

Roles entities are named identifiers used to map a collection of actions from a
user to either a specific project or across an entire domain.

Additional required attributes:

- `name` (string)

  Globally unique name of the role.

Example entity:

    {
        "role": {
            "id": "76e72a",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/roles/76e72a"
            },
            "name": "admin"
        }
    }

### Services: `/v3/services`

Service entities represent web services in the OpenStack deployment. A service
may have zero or more endpoints associated with it, although a service with zero
endpoints is essentially useless in an OpenStack configuration.

Additional required attributes:

- `type` (string)

  Describes the API implemented by the service. The following values are
  recognized within the OpenStack ecosystem: `compute`, `image`, `ec2`,
  `identity`, `volume`, `network`. To support non-core and future projects, the
  value should not be validated against this list.

Optional attributes:

- `name` (string)

  User-facing name of the service.

- `enabled` (boolean)

  Setting this value to `false` prevents the service and its endpoints from
  appearing in the service catalog.

Example entity:

    {
        "service": {
            "enabled": true,
            "id": "ee057c",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/services/ee057c"
            },
            "name": "Keystone",
            "type": "identity"
        }
    }

### Endpoints: `/v3/endpoints`

Endpoint entities represent URL endpoints for OpenStack web services.

Additional required attributes:

- `service_id` (string)

  References the service to which the endpoint belongs.

- `interface` (string)

  Describes the visibility of the endpoint according to one of the following
  values:

    - `public`: intended for consumption by end users, generally on a publicly
      available network interface

    - `internal`: intended for consumption by end users, generally on an
      unmetered internal network interface

    - `admin`: intended only for consumption by those needing administrative
      access to the service, generally on a secure network interface

- `url` (string)

  Fully qualified URL of the service endpoint.

Optional attributes:

- `region` (string)

  Represents the geographic location of the service endpoint, if relevant to
  the deployment. The value of this attribute is intended to be implementation
  specific in meaning.

- `enabled` (boolean)

  Setting this value to `false` prevents the endpoint from appearing in the
  service catalog.

Example entity:

    {
        "endpoint": {
            "enabled": true,
            "id": "6fedc0",
            "interface": "internal",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/endpoints/6fedc0"
            },
            "region": "north",
            "service_id": "ee057c",
            "url": "http://identity:35357/"
        }
    }

### Tokens

Tokens represent an authenticated user's identity and, potentially, explicit
authorization on a specific project or domain.

Tokens are generated by the Identity service via authentication, and may be
subsequently validated and/or revoked.

Unlike all other resources in the Identity API, `token` objects returned by the
API do not have `id` attributes. While `token` objects do have identifiers,
they are not passed in resource URL's nor are they included in the objects
themselves. Instead, they are passed in the `X-Auth-Token` and
`X-Subject-Token` headers, along with a `Vary: X-Auth-Token, X-Subject-Token`
header to inform caches of this pattern.

`token` objects are only created by the identity service implementation;
clients are not expected to create them. Instead, clients provide the service
with `auth` objects in exchange for `token` objects.

Required attributes:

- `expires_at` (string, ISO 8601 extended format date time with microseconds)

  Specifies the expiration time of the token. Once established, a token's
  expiration may not be changed. A token may be revoked ahead of expiration. If
  the value represents a time in the past, the token is invalid.

- `issued_at` (string, ISO 8601 extended format date time with microseconds)

  Specifies the time at which the token was issued.

- `user` (object)

  References the user to which the token belongs.

  Includes the full resource description of a user.

- `methods` (list)

  The `methods` attribute indicates the accumulated set of authentication
  methods used to obtain the token. For example, if the token was obtained by
  `password` authentication, it will contain `password`. Later, if the token is
  exchanged using the `token` authentication method one or more times, the
  subsequently created tokens will contain both `password` and `token` in their
  `methods` attribute.

  Notice the difference between `methods` and multifactor authentication. The
  `methods` attribute merely indicates the methods used to authenticate the
  user for the given token. It is up to the client to look for specific methods
  to determine the total number of factors.

Optional attributes:

- `project` (object)

  Specifies a project authorization scope of the token. If this attribute is
  not provided, then the token is not authorized to access any projects. This
  attribute must not be included if a `domain` attribute is included.

  Includes the full resource description of a project.

- `domain` (object)

  Specifies a domain authorization scope of the token. This is to provide
  authorization appropriate to domain-wide APIs, for example user and group
  management within a domain. Domain authorization does not grant authorization
  to projects within the domain. If this attribute is not provided, then the
  token is not authorized to access any domain level resources. This attribute
  must not be included if a `project` attribute is included.

  Includes the full resource description of a domain.

- `catalog` (object)

  Specifies all endpoints available to/for the token.

  FIXME(dolph): revise with specific expectations.

Example entity:

    {
        "token": {
            "expires_at": "2013-02-27T18:30:59.999999Z",
            "issued_at": "2013-02-27T16:30:59.999999Z",
            "methods": [
                "password"
            ],
            "user": {
                "domain": {
                    "id": "1789d1",

                    },
                    "name": "example.com"
                }
                "email": "joe@example.com",
                "id": "0ca8f6",
                "links": {
                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/users/0ca8f6"
                },
                "name": "Joe"
            }
        }
    }

### Policy

Policies represent arbitrarily serialized policy engine rule sets to be
consumed by remote services.

Additional required attributes:

- `blob` (string)

  The policy rule set itself, as a serialized blob.

- `type` (string)

  The MIME Media Type of the serialized policy blob.

Example entity:

    {
        "policy": {
            "blob": "{\"default\": false}",
            "id": "c41a4c",
            "links": {
                "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/policies/c41a4c"
            },
            "type": "application/json"
        }
    }

Core API
--------

### Versions

#### List versions; `GET /`

(TBD: This needs additional definition to match the detail below)

### Tokens

Use cases:

- Given a user name & password, get a token to represent the user.
- Given a token, get a list of other domain/projects the user can access.
- Given a token, validate the token and return user, domain, project,
  roles and potential endpoints.
- Given a valid token, request another token with a different domain/project
  (change domain/project being represented with the user).
- Given a valid token, force it's immediate revocation.

#### Authenticate: `POST /auth/tokens`

Each request to create a token contains an attribute with `identiy`
information and, optionally, a `scope` describing the authorization scope being
requested. Example request structure:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": { ... },
            "scope": { ... }
        }
    }

##### Authentication: `authentication`

Authentication is performed by specifying a list of authentication `methods`,
each with a corresponding object, containing any attributes required by the
authentication method. Example request structure for three arbitrary
authentication methods:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": ["x", "y", "z"],
                "x": { ... },
                "y": { ... },
                "z": { ... }
            }
        }
    }

###### The `password` authentication method

To authenticate by `password`, the user must be uniquely identified in addition
to providing a `password` attribute.

The `user` may be identified by either `id` or `name`. A user's `id` is
sufficient to uniquely identify the `user`. Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "id": "0ca8f6",
                        "password": "secrete"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

If the `user` is specified by `name`, then the `domain` of the `user` must also
be specified in order to uniquely identify the `user`. Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "domain": {
                            "id": "1789d1"
                        },
                        "name": "Joe",
                        "password": "secrete"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Alternatively, a `domain` `name` may be used to uniquely identify the `user`.
Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "domain": {
                            "name": "example.com"
                        },
                        "name": "Joe",
                        "password": "secrete"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

###### The `token` authentication method

If the authenticating user is already in possession of a valid token, then that
token is sufficient to identity the user. This method is typically used in
combination with request to change authorization scope.

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "token"
                ],
                "token": {
                    "id": "e80b74"
                }
            }
        }
    }

##### Scope: `scope`

An authorization scope, including either a project or domain, can be optionally
specified as part of the request. If both a domain and a project are specified,
an HTTP 400 Bad Request will be returned, as a token cannot be simultaneously
scoped to both a project and domain.

A `project` may be specified by either `id` or `name`. An `id` is sufficient to
uniquely identify a `project`. Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "id": "0ca8f6",
                        "password": "secrete"
                    }
                }
            },
            "scope": {
                "project": {
                    "id": "263fd9"
                }
            }
        }
    }

If a `project` is specified by `name`, then the `domain` of the `project` must
also be specified in order to uniquely identify the `project`. Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "id": "0ca8f6",
                        "password": "secrete"
                    }
                }
            },
            "scope": {
                "project": {
                    "domain": {
                        "id": "1789d1"
                    },
                    "name": "project-x"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Alternatively, a `domain` `name` may be used to uniquely identify the
`project`. Example request:

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "id": "0ca8f6",
                        "password": "secrete"
                    }
                }
            },
            "scope": {
                "project": {
                    "domain": {
                        "name": "example.com"
                    },
                    "name": "project-x"
                }
            }
        }
    }

If neither a `project` nor a `domain` is provided for `scope`, and the
authenticating `user` has a defined default project (the user's
`default_project_id` attribute), then this will be treated as the preferred
authorization scope. If there is no default project defined, then a token will
be issued without an explicit scope of authorization.

##### Authentication responses

A response without an explicit authorization scope does not contain a
`catalog`, `project`, `domain` or `roles` but can be used to uniquely identify
the user. Example response:

    Headers:
        X-Subject-Token: e80b74

    {
        "token": {
            "expires_at": "2013-02-27T18:30:59.999999Z",
            "issued_at": "2013-02-27T16:30:59.999999Z",
            "methods": [
                "password"
            ],
            "user": {
                "domain": {
                    "id": "1789d1",
                    "links": {
                        "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/domains/1789d1"
                    },
                    "name": "example.com"
                },
                "id": "0ca8f6",
                "links": {
                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/users/0ca8f6"
                },
                "name": "Joe"
            }
        }
    }

Notice that token ID is not part of the token data. Rather, it is conveyed in
the `X-Subject-Token` header.

A token scoped to a `project` will also have a service `catalog`, along with
the user's roles applicable to the `project`. Example response:

    Headers: X-Subject-Token

    X-Subject-Token: e80b74

                    "name": "admin"
                },

                    },
                    "name": "member"
                }
            ],
            "user": {

                        "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/domains/1789d1"
                    },
                    "name": "example.com"
                },
                "id": "0ca8f6",
                "links": {
                    "self": "http://identity:35357/v3/users/0ca8f6"
                },
                "name": "Joe"
            }
        }
    }

A token scoped to a `domain` will also have a service `catalog` along with the
user's roles applicable to the `domain`. Example response:

    Headers: X-Subject-Token

    X-Subject-Token: e80b74

    }

##### Authentication failures

Several authentication errors are possible, including 403 Forbidden and 409
Conflict, but here's an example of an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response:

    Status: 401 Not Authorized

    {
        "error": {
            "code": 401,
            "message": "The request you have made requires authentication",
            "title": "Not Authorized"
        }
    }

Optionally, the Identity service implementation may return an `authentication`
attribute to indicate the supported authentication methods.

    Status: 401 Not Authorized

    {
        "error": {
            "code": 401,
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password",
                    "token",
                    "challenge-response"
                ]
            },
            "message": "Need to authenticate with one or more supported methods",
            "title": "Not Authorized"
        }
    }

For authentication processes which require multiple round trips, the Identity
service implementation may return an HTTP 401 Not Authorized with additional
information for the next authentication step.

For example:

    Status: 401 Not Authorized

    {
        "error": {
            "code": 401,
            "identity": {
                "challenge-response": {
                    "challenge": "What was the zip code of your birth place?",
                    "session_id": "123456"
                },
                "methods": [
                    "challenge-response"
                ]
            },
            "message": "Additional authentications steps required.",
            "title": "Not Authorized"
        }
    }

#### Validate token: `GET /auth/tokens`

To validate a token using the Identity API, pass your own token in the
`X-Auth-Token` header, and the token to be validated in the `X-Subject-Token`
header. Example request:

    Headers:
        X-Auth-Token: 1dd7e3
        X-Subject-Token: c67580

No request body is required.

The Identity service will return the exact same response as when the subject
token was issued by `POST /auth/tokens`.

#### Check token: `HEAD /auth/tokens`

This call is identical to `GET /auth/tokens`, but no response body is provided,
even if an error occurs or the token is invalid. A 204 response indicates that
the `X-Subject-Token` is valid.

#### Revoke token: `DELETE /auth/tokens`

This call is identical to `HEAD /auth/tokens` except that the `X-Subject-Token`
token is immediately invalidated, regardless of it's `expires_at` attribute. An
additional `X-Auth-Token` is not required.

### Catalog

        },
        "name": "my domain"
    }

#### Delete domain: `DELETE /domains/{domain_id}`

Deleting a domain will delete all the entities owned by it (Users,
Groups & Projects), as well as any Credentials and Role grants that
relate to these entities.

In order to minimize the risk of an inadvertent deletion of a
domain and its entities, a domain must first be disabled (using the
update domain API) before a successful delete domain API call can
be made. Attempting to delete an enabled domain will result in an
HTTP 403 Forbidden response.
