    <para>The OpenStack Identity Service has the following key
        concepts: </para>

            <term>User</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A digital representation of a person, system, or
                    service that uses OpenStack cloud services.
                    OpenStack Identity authentication services
                    validate that an incoming request is being made by
                    the user who claims to be making the call. Users
                    have a login and may be assigned tokens to access
                    resources. Users may be directly assigned to a
                    particular tenant and behave as if they are
                    contained in that tenant.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>In the context of OpenStack Identity Service,
                    the act of confirming the identity of a user or
                    the truth of a claim. OpenStack Identity Service
                    confirms that an incoming request is being made by
                    the user who claims to be making the call by
                    validating a set of claims that the user is
                    making. These claims are initially in the form of
                    a set of credentials (username &amp; password, or
                    username and API key). After initial confirmation,
                    OpenStack Identity Service issues the user a
                    token, which the user can then provide to
                    demonstrate that their identity has been
                    authenticated when making subsequent requests.

            <term>Token</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An arbitrary bit of text that is used to access
                    resources. Each token has a scope that describes
                    which resources are accessible with it. A token
                    may be revoked at anytime and is valid for a
                    finite duration. </para>
                <para>While OpenStack Identity Service supports
                    token-based authentication in this release, the
                    intention is for it to support additional
                    protocols in the future. The intent is for it to
                    be an integration service foremost, and not a
                    aspire to be a full-fledged identity store and
                    management solution. </para>

            <term>Tenant</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A container used to group or isolate resources
                    and/or identity objects. Depending on the service
                    operator, a tenant can map to a customer, account,
                    organization, or project. </para>

            <term>Service</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An OpenStack service, such as Compute (Nova),
                    Object Storage (Swift), or Image Service (Glance).
                    A service provides one or more endpoints through
                    which users can access resources and perform
                    operations. </para>

            <term>Endpoint</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>An network-accessible address, usually described
                    by a URL, where a service may be accessed. If
                    using an extension for templates, you can create
                    an endpoint template, which represents the
                    templates of all the consumable services that are
                    available across the regions. </para>

        <varlistentry>
            <term>Role</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>A personality that a user assumes when
                    performing a specific set of operations. A role
                    includes a set of right and privileges. A user
                    assuming that role inherits those rights and
                    privileges. </para>
                <para>In OpenStack Identity Service, a token that is
                    issued to a user includes the list of roles that
                    user can assume. Services that are being called by
                    that user determine how they interpret the set of
                    roles a user has and which operations or resources
                    each roles grants access to. </para>
